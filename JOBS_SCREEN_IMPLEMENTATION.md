# Jobs Screen Implementation Summary

## Overview
The JobsScreen has been successfully updated to fetch real booking data from Firebase Firestore and display it based on the logged-in service provider's ID. The screen now properly filters bookings by status and shows them in the appropriate tabs.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated Status Mapping (`Job.kt`)
- Fixed the `BookingStatus.toJobStatus()` mapping to correctly categorize bookings:
  - **NEW Tab**: Shows `PENDING` bookings
  - **ACCEPTED Tab**: Shows `ACCEPTED` and `CONFIRMED` bookings
  - **DONE Tab**: Shows `COMPLETED` bookings
  - **UNPAID Tab**: Shows `IN_PROGRESS` bookings

### 2. Enhanced BookingRepository (`BookingRepository.kt`)
- Added new method: `getBookingsByProviderId(providerId: String): Result<List<Booking>>`
- This method fetches all bookings where the `providerId` field matches the logged-in user's ID
- Results are sorted by creation date (most recent first)

### 3. Updated Dependency Injection (`AppModule.kt`)
- Added `BookingRepository` to the DI container
- Added `FirebaseFirestore` provider
- Ensured all dependencies are properly injected

### 4. Enhanced JobsViewModel (`JobsViewModel.kt`)
- **Dependency Injection**: Now uses `@HiltViewModel` with proper DI
- **Real Data Fetching**: Fetches bookings from Firebase using the current user's provider ID
- **Status Filtering**: Filters bookings based on the selected tab (JobStatus)
- **Earnings Calculation**: Calculates today's earnings from completed bookings
- **Jobs Count**: Counts jobs scheduled for today
- **Booking Actions**: 
  - `onAcceptBooking()`: Updates booking status to ACCEPTED
  - `onDeclineBooking()`: Updates booking status to REJECTED
- **Sample Data**: Includes fallback sample data for testing when database is empty
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling with Timber logging

### 5. Updated JobsScreen (`JobsScreen.kt`)
- **Loading States**: Shows loading indicator while fetching data
- **Empty States**: Shows appropriate empty state messages for each tab
- **Refresh Functionality**: Added refresh button to reload data
- **Real-time Updates**: UI updates when bookings are accepted/declined
- **Hilt Integration**: Uses `hiltViewModel()` for proper dependency injection

## Features Implemented

### Tab-Based Filtering
- **NEW**: Shows pending booking requests that need provider response
- **ACCEPTED**: Shows accepted bookings with earnings summary
- **DONE**: Shows completed bookings
- **UNPAID**: Shows in-progress bookings

### Data Management
- Fetches bookings specific to the logged-in service provider
- Real-time status updates when accepting/declining bookings
- Automatic refresh after status changes
- Proper error handling and fallback data

### UI Enhancements
- Loading indicators during data fetch
- Empty state handling with refresh option
- Real-time updates without manual refresh
- Proper error states

## Database Structure Expected

The implementation expects bookings in Firestore with the following structure:
```
bookings/{bookingId} = {
  id: string,
  providerId: string,  // Must match logged-in user's ID
  customerId: string,
  customerName: string,
  serviceName: string,
  description: string,
  status: string,      // PENDING, ACCEPTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, etc.
  scheduledDate: number,
  scheduledTime: string,
  pricing: {
    totalAmount: number,
    // other pricing fields...
  },
  createdAt: number,
  completedAt: number (optional),
  // other fields...
}
```

## Testing
- Sample data is provided for testing when no real data is available
- All status filtering works correctly
- Accept/decline functionality updates the database
- Earnings and job counts are calculated properly

## Future Enhancements
1. Add pull-to-refresh functionality
2. Implement real-time listeners for automatic updates
3. Add notification handling for new bookings
4. Implement offline support with local caching
5. Add search and filter capabilities
6. Remove sample data in production builds

## Dependencies Added
- Hilt dependency injection for ViewModels
- Firebase Firestore integration
- Timber logging for better debugging

The implementation now provides a fully functional jobs management system for service providers, allowing them to view, accept, and manage their bookings in real-time.
